RocketSeat Experience Hackathon Challenge
 
Our challenge was to promote technology learning among young people in high school.
By doing a case study, we were able to identify a high interest among young people on social media platforms, namely Snapchat and Instagram.

Based on this scenario, we arrived at a social network model focused on immersive and fun learning. Where all users can send video lessons and even have questions on any subject. Videos should be short, with cool tips and features that a programmer can build, for example:
- Light turns on when opening door
- App of a game
- Robo answering question
- Automated connection
- Among many others

Within the platform, we created a Gamification model, based on scores, which will be generated through the posted content, likes and comments. To involve schools we create a link between the user and the school and its teacher. Being able to create a ranking of schools and teachers based on the points of their students.
